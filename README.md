# 🎓 Student Dropout and Academic Success Predictor

This project develops and deploys a machine learning model that predicts whether a student will **dropout**, **enroll**, or **graduate** from their academic program, based on various academic, demographic, and socio-economic factors. The prediction is served via a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handles numerical and categorical features, including standardization and one-hot encoding.
* **Model Training:** Trains a Neural Network (PyTorch) using hyperparameter optimization (Bayesian Optimization with Optuna).
* **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Interactive Web App (Streamlit):** Allows users to input student data and get real-time dropout predictions.
* **Cloud Deployment Ready:** Configured for seamless deployment on Streamlit Cloud, including on-the-fly model training if artifacts are not present.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python** (3.8+)
* **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
* **PyTorch:** For deep learning model implementation.
* **Scikit-learn:** For data preprocessing pipelines.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Optuna:** For hyperparameter optimization.
* **Joblib:** For saving and loading preprocessor and model metadata.
